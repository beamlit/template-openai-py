## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-openai-py.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd template-openai-py

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start the server
bl serve --hotreload

# In another terminal, test the agent
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust
- **Blaxel Platform Setup:** Complete Blaxel setup by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart)
  - **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```
  - **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
    ```bash
    bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
    ```

## üíª Installation

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-openai-py.git
cd template-openai-py
uv sync
```
## üîß Usage

### Running Locally

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bl serve --hotreload
```

For production run:

```bash
bl serve
```

_Note:_ The development server automatically restarts when you make changes to the source code.

### Testing

You can test your OpenAI agent locally:

```bash
# Using the Blaxel CLI chat interface
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

Example queries you can test:

```
What is the weather in Paris?
```

```
Help me analyze some data
```

```
Can you assist with writing a summary?
```

You can also run it directly with specific input:

```bash
bl run agent blaxel-agent --local --data '{"input": "What is the weather in Paris?"}'
```

### Deployment

When you are ready to deploy your agent:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration files under the `.blaxel` directory to deploy your OpenAI agent on the Blaxel platform.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blaxel Platform Issues**:
   - Ensure you're logged in to your workspace: `bl login MY-WORKSPACE`
   - Verify models are available: `bl get models`
   - Check that functions exist: `bl get functions`

2. **OpenAI API Connection Issues**:
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check API rate limits and usage quotas
   - Ensure network connectivity to OpenAI endpoints
   - Test API access with a simple request

3. **Assistant Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify assistant creation and configuration in the code
   - Check assistant permissions and capabilities
   - Ensure tools are properly registered with the assistant
   - Monitor assistant usage and performance

4. **Function Calling Problems**:
   - Verify tool function definitions and schemas
   - Check function parameter validation
   - Ensure function execution permissions
   - Review function response formats

5. **Python Environment Issues**:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.10+
   - Try `uv sync --upgrade` to update dependencies
   - Check for conflicting package versions
   - Verify virtual environment activation with UV
